Upstream snapshot: 855ff706b7bedea633d2f7b1a5dafa1458f78698

## Synchronization

```sh
git fetch --unshallow upstream  # once, if this clone is shallow
git fetch upstream
git switch main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

Review conflicts and dependency/runtime changes before executing upstream code.
Curator documentation is additive; upstream copyright and README are retained.
Security: see CURATOR_SECURITY.md. Fork Actions remain disabled until manually reviewed.
Troubleshooting: shallow merge errors require fetching full history; authentication errors require `gh auth status`.
